# **Welcome To My Weather API Project!**

### **Version 1.0**

- Basic functionality is working properly!
- Users are able to search up a city and see the current weather conditions, temperature (in Faranheit only right now) and the current date/time of the city they searched up.
- Error handling is included in the code, just in case something goes wrong.
- More styling will be coming with future updates to this project, as well as maybe some more functionality!
